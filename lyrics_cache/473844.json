Whose minds, sneakin' out\nA hazy sense of evidence for \nwhat life is all about\nIt's real love and everything, a family, no scattering\nDaddy swing the children like Hollywood happy end\nJust like so many men, I look for almost everything\nMeanwhile whistling, here we come, sing again\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Eased]\nNo matter how close to perfect it is\nIt's taken me too far, I'm afraid, I'm obsessed with it, vex with it\nGood's not enough, be the best in it\nIn order to bebest, I can never stop flexin' it\nYou flex it to the max and it feels like sex with it\nIt's made you to the boss and you feel you're blessed with it\nNow everybody want it, you start protecting it\nThis is when you wish you had no more stress with it, so\n[Hook: Ear]\nGoing for a slowlife, almost understand\nTime has got no end, let the soul drive\nGoing for a slowlife, almost understand\nTime has got no end, let the soul drive\n(Slow down)\nGoing for a slowlife, almost understand\nTime has got no end, let the soul drive\nGoing for a slowlife, almost understand\nTime has got no end, let the soul drive\n[Outro: Ear]\nGoing for a slowlife\nSlowlife\nGoing for a slowlife\nLet the soul drive",
