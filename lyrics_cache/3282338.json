It is stylistically similar to Kygo’s older songs.\n\nThe song was first previewed on Kygo’s  Facebook page.\n[Verse 1: Bonnie McKee]\nI love you more than money\nLove you more than dope\nKnow I got a temper\nBut if it came down to it\nUp against the ropes\nI'll be in your corner\n[Pre-Chorus: Bonnie McKee]\nGonna just come out and say it\nI think both of us are crazy\nBut I love you anyhow\nIt's just how we get down\nOne of us lost and the other is found\nMyself a partner\nEven though it's getting darker\nIf you feel like hope is gone\nWe can make it 'til dawn\nBaby, we gotta just keep holding on\n[Chorus: Bonnie McKee]\nDon't let me go, don't let me go\nI can't take it\n'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun\nYou know that I'm your ride or die\nSo quit thinking\n'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun\n'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Bonnie McKee]\nI hate your taste in music\nHate it when you smoke\nBut your kiss is fire\nAnd if I said I'd leave you\nIf I said it goes\nThen I'd be a liar\n[Pre-Chorus: Bonnie McKee]\nGonna just come out and say it\nI think both of us are crazy\nBut I love you anyhow\nIt's just how we get down\nOne of us lost and the other is found\nMyself a partner\nEven though it's getting darker\nIf you feel like hope is gone\nWe can make it 'till dawn\nBaby, we gotta just keep holding on\n[Chorus: Bonnie McKee]\nDon't let me go, don't let me go\nI can't take it\n'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun\nYou know that I'm your ride or die\nSo quit thinking\n'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun\n'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun\n\n\n\n[Outro: Bonnie McKee]\nYou can't let me go\nI'm your radio\nKeep on turning me up\nOh, you can't let me go\nI'm your radio\nKeep on turning me up",
