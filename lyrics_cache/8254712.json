We got money, we got time\nRiding shotgun through the night\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nI got the fever\nI got the fever runnin' through my soul (My soul)\nI got the fever in the night\nIf it ain't wrong, then it ain't right\nFever when the lights down low\nI got the fever\n[Build]\n(Fever)\n(Fever)\nI got the fever\n[Drop]\nI got the fever\nI got the fever runnin' through my soul\nI got the fever in the night\nIf it ain't wrong, then it ain't right\nFever when the lights down low\nI got the fever",
