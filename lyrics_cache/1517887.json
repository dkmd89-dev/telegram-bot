Hands down!\nLight the sun\nHands up!\nYou gotta light the sun!\nCome on\nOver the top\n[Verse I: Ear]\nYou are sounding the space\nNavigating your base\nYou know what to select\nSail on your soundtrack\nDon't get lost in the maze\nLet's go on face to face\nAll that you gotta check\nWe are all in one pack\nIt's too dark nowadays\nBut don't burn the whole place\nYou know bullets are wack\nThere's no need to attack\nCome on follow our trace\nWe know some better ways\nWe are bringing the light back\nBefore you break your neck\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Ear]\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\n[Verse II: Eased]\nNow daylight's back go out and check\nMan, you can choose good or bad news\nActing your act that is your truth\nGet in the mood, now make a move\nHere's what you use - older than age\nStronger than youth it cuts you loose\nMake sure you're ok don't get confused\nYou're on your track, you've got the clue\n[Chorus: Ear]\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\n\n\n\nCome on!\n[Bridge: Ear]\nWhen it snows in your heart\nThings seem to fall apart\nFix it dance the sun dance\nWatch your soul reach out\nAnd it touch our crowd\nGo on dance the sun dance\nYou got power you are smart\nAnd you know how to start\nSo you dance the sun dance\nGetting rid of your doubt\nCause your doubt's just a cloud\nAnd you dance the sun dance\n[Chorus: Ear]\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\nLight the sun, ay\nLight the sun\nMove on up and\n\n\n\nWe're gonna light this sun\n[Outro: \nDJ Illvibe\n & \nEar\n]\nLight up the sky\nDance the sun dance\nLight up the sky\nDance the sun dance\nExcuse me as I kiss the sky\nDance the sun dance",
