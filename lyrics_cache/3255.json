Better days\nGot me thinkin' 'bout better days\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHey!\nBetter days\nGot me thinkin' 'bout better days\n[Verse 2]\nThinkin' back as an adolescent\nWho would've guessed that in my future years I'd be stressin'?\nSome say the ghetto's sick and corrupted\nPlus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with\nTryna keep my head up and stay strong\nAll my homies slangin' yayo all day long\nBut they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke\nSavin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope\nI got a girl and I love her, but she broke too\nAnd so am I — I can't take her to the place she wanna go to\nSo, we argue and play fight, all day and night\nMakin' passionate love 'til the daylight\nPlus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent\nGuess it's time to see who really is your friend\nTell me you pregnant and I'm amazed\nSo many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days\n (For better days)\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nBetter days, better days\nHey! Better days\nThinkin' 'bout better days\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHey!\nBetter days\nGot me thinkin' 'bout better days\n[Verse 3]\nNow, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools\nSince back in high school, we was true, me and you\nHardly parted or separated, we stayed faded\nAffiliated with gang-bangers and still made it\nUp in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him\nStill dressin' like grown men when rollin'\nOut in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks\nGot a place in my heart, homie, stay smart\nLocked you up in the pen', and gave you three to ten\nI send you letters with naked flicks of old friends\nHopin' you well, I know it's hell\nDoin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail\nAnd me, I'm doin' cool\nI settled down, had a family, workin' and night school\nEvery once in a while, I reminisce\nAnd I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nBetter days, better days\nHey! Better days\nThinkin' 'bout better days\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHey!\nBetter days\nGot me thinkin' 'bout better days\n[Outro]\nI send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh\nClinton lockdown, Rikers Island\nAll them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe\nE Block, F Block, lower H\nN-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate\nAll the peoples I met along the way\nBetter days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!",
