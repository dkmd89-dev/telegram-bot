We're giving you stuff to relax\nTo have sex, to cheer you up when you're vexed\nYou had a wife, now she's your ex\nGo get a life, we give you soundtrax!\nThis is how we flex\n[Verse 1 - Enuff]\nWe plant this sound downtown like a seed growing\nYou wanna dance so we must keep it going\nA big grieve when we leave every-body knowing:\nSeeed is a serious dancehall-rock-rolling!\nLike the morning star, so we keep glowing\nYou can hear us from far through your speaker blowing\nSeeed, the musical doctor we keep sowing the sound\nFeel the medicine flowing\n[Hook - Enuff]\nNext! We're giving you stuff to relax\nTo have sex, to cheer you up when you're vexed\nYou had a wife, now she's your ex\nGo get a life, we give you soundtrax!\nThis is how we flex\n[Bridge - Miss Platnum + \nEnuff\n]\nSeeed don't stop to rock the spot all night\n(We rocking the spot tonight)\nAll right\n(We making a pop)\n\n\n\n[Verse 2 - Ear]\nYou need medecine we gonna give you some\nYou don't have money, you can pay your fun\nCall us doctors, we trick, if you are sick we will kick\nThe shit out of you\nJust say you want us to\nThink loud say what you gonna say\nDon't doubt we won't be delayed\nUnderstand that we got you\nWe have found you and watch you\nThen we touch you\nWith the surgeons blade\nRejoice we are back on your way\nYeah boys let's ride another day\nPut some heart in your head\nAn a thought in your heart\nFeel the power, this is state of the art\n[Hook - Enuff]\nNext!
