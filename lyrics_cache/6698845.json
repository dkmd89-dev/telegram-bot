The song marks the first collaboration between Kygo and Scottish singer James Gillespie.\n\nThroughout the song Gillespie sings about a lost lover and days… \nRead More\n \n[Verse 1]\nYou were my closest friend\nMy strength in days gone mad\nBut I spent my time in shallow sheets\nI should've seen your hand\nI didn't see the signs\nWas blinded by the lights\nAnd lost where I belong\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought that we'd grow old\nGive kids our bad advice\nNow I'm alone\nYou went and left me with these sleepless nights\nYou took my warmth and soul\nLeft me with doubt and cold\nIs this where I belong?\n[Chorus]\nGone are the days of young\nBetter run for cover\nThere's no one here to save you from yoursеlf\nAnd you'll discover it's hard\nYou don't know how to carry on\nGone are thе days of young\nBetter run for cover\nWhen everything you love is lying six feet under, I know\nYou don't know how but you carry on\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days are longer now\nMy nights spent wondering why\nAnd I get mad inside\nDid you fight back or even try?\nYou didn't see the signs\nWere blinded by the lights\nYou lost where you came from\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe're not so different, no\nWe grew up wanting more\nBut I found it easy 'cause I left my morals at the door\nYou took an honest heart\nAnd watched it fall apart\nYou lost before you started\n[Chorus]\nGone are the days of young\nBetter run for cover\nThere's no one here to save you from yourself\nAnd you'll discover it's hard\nYou don't know how to carry on\nGone are the days of young\nBetter run for cover\nWhen everything you love is lying six feet under, I know\nYou don't know how but you carry on\n\n\n\n[Outro]\nGone are the days of young\nBetter run for cover\nThere's no one here to save you from yourself\nAnd you'll discover it's hard\nYou don't know how to carry on",
