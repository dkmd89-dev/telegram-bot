Oh, oh\nAll of the voices in your head, they don't mean nothing\nTell me you feel it, make me believe it\nCan't you say it to me loudеr?\n[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]\nI've guided you to my love, babе\nNow I wanna reciprocate it\nOpen your mouth, let it fall out\nOh, do you want a demonstration?\n\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels, \nJulia Michaels & Chance Peña\n]\nIt could be so \nsimple, simple\nFor more than just a \nlittle, little\nJust speak your mind, I've spoken mine\nCome show me that I'm right about you\nIf you love me, baby, tell me now\n[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Chance Peña]\nSay it to me louder\nWhy can't you lay it on me, your power? Oh, oh\nAll of the voices in your head, they don't mean nothing\nTell me you feel it, make me believe it\nOh can't you say it to me louder?\nDo you love me baby?\n[Post-Chorus: Julia Michaels]\nLouder\n(Baby, tell me)\nDo you love me, baby?\nBaby, can you say it?\nBaby, love me\nDo you love me, baby?\nBaby, can you say it?\nBaby, love me louder\n[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Chance Peña, \nJulia Michaels\n]\nSay it to me louder (\nBaby, tell me\n)\nWhy can't you lay it on me, your power? Oh, oh (\nBaby, can you\n)\nAll of the voices in your head, they don't mean nothing\nTell me you feel it, make me believe it\nOh can't you say it to me louder? (\nBaby, tell me\n)\n\n\n\n[Outro: Chance Peña]\nSay it to me louder\nWhy can't you say it to me louder?",
