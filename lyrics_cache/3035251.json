It was first performed at Ultra Miami 2017 with another song, “Never Let You Go” featuring John Newman.\n\nOn 9 October 2017, Kygo… \nRead More\n \n[Verse 1: The Night Game]\nThis is our last goodbye\nDon't come and find me\nSo hard to see you cry\nPlease, somebody blind me\n[Pre-Chorus 1: The Night Game]\n'Cause I can feel it\nI'm still lagging onto every word\nMy heart is beating\nAnd I'm sorry that I left you hurt\n[Chorus: The Night Game]\nWe were kids in love\nAnd then we grew up\nBut won't you hold me close tonight\nLike we're kids in love?\nKids in love\nKids in love\nKids in love\n[Post-Chorus: The Night Game]\nWe were kids in love\nWe were kids in love\n[Verse 2: The Night Game & Maja Francis]\nEngine on, in the drive\nRunning for hours\nSlowly, we twist the knife\nWe're fallin' like towers\n\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2: The Night Game & Maja Francis]\nAnd I can feel it\nAnd we're running out of hope tonight\nI hear you breathing\nAs we're hanging on to you and I, oh\n[Chorus: The Night Game & Maja Francis]\nWe were kids in love\nAnd then we grew up\nBut won't you hold me close tonight\nLike we're kids in love?\nKids in love (Oh)\nKids in love (Oh)\nKids in love (Oh)\n[Outro: The Night Game & \nMaja Francis\n]\nMaybe I could cope if I could hold you\nWe were kids in love\nOne last time, one last time\nAnd wherever you go, I'll just hold you forever\nMaybe I could cope if I could hold you\nWe were kids in love\nKids in love \n(Oh)\nKids in love \n(Oh)\nKids in love \n(Oh)",
