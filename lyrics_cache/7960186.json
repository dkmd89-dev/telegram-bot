Why does my mind go racin'?\nThis beautiful silence but I feel like I'm always waitin'\nLike it's just a matter of time 'til it shatters\n[Chorus]\nDarlin', can we freeze?\nLet me save this perfect memory\nRemember how it feels like flyin' in the dark\nLike I must be awake inside a dream\nDarlin', can we freeze?\n'Cause even though you're right here next to me\nA part of me still feels like nothin' ever lasts\nLike I'm already missin' you and me\nOh-oh, can we freeze?\n[Build]\nOh-oh, can we\n[Drop]\nDarlin', can we freeze?\nDarlin', can we freeze?\nCan we freeze?",
