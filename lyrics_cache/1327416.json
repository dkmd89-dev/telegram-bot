Come, I beat you hollow!\nToo fast for the dogs, I fly like a swallow\nToo fast for the girls, I still stay alone\nAlways live in a different groove\nThat's life of rocket man on the move\nI'm one in a million, always get the jiggy on\nReady for the giddeon, no time to loose!\n[Hook - Enuff]\nYou can't hold me\nThat's why I'm still lonely\nYou can't hold me\nThat's why I'm still lonely\n\n\n\n[Verse 2 - Eased]\nGirl don't you try to hold me, I'll be gone, Faster than the roadrunner\nSo many lovely girls at home feel alone\nWaiting for a younger lover\nIt's irresponsible of me, to keep my sweets for just one mother\nThat's why I'm always on the run, I can't stay longer than for one summer\nReady to overtake-racing like a speed devil\nNo time to take a breake-pacing at top level\nFeel my body ake-searching for the one to hold me at the place I belong\n[Hook - Enuff]\nYou can't hold me\nThat's why I'm still lonely\nYou can't hold me\nThat's why I'm still lonely\n[Bridge]\nYou can't hold me\nThat's why I'm still lonely\nYou can't hold me\nThat's why I'm still lonely\n[Verse 3 - Ear]\nPlease go away don't gimme a hard day\nAm I speaking too fast for you?\nWould you do, what I want you to?\nI can't do nothing more for you\nFind a barber to talk to, boo\nI got to get rid of you\nThat dude doesn't have a clue\nHe's not in my crew\nTell him what you gonna do\nGirl you stick like glue\nI'm on my way, stepp of my shoe\nI'm sorry, I don't feel for you\nNo more to say, have a nice day",
