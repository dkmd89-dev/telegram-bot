Only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas\n[Chorus]\nJesus, Jesus, Jesus\nMan, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out\nI'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house\n[Verse 2]\nAround 3 AM, dog\nI was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall\nBad mamacita, Miami Heat her, put her in a two-seater\nToo bad I couldn't three-peat her\nNeed a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper\nHouse full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter\nWith more stamps than a skinny nigga, got tats on my visa\nI know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it, I mean\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nJesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus\nMan, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out\nI'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house\nJesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus\nMan, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out\nI'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house\n[Outro]\nJesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus\nI might fuck 'round, lose my mind\nJesus\nJesus, Jesus, Jesus\nJesus",
