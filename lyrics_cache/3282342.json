The song also marks Kygo’s first collaboration with Canadian rock, alternative singer/songwriter Billy Raffoul.\n[Verse 1: Billy Raffoul]\nYou're more than just a notch in my belt\nA story to tell\nThe only thing on my mind\nAnd it's keeping me up at night (Hmm)\nI know you're making magic somewhere\nBut not by yourself\nThat might be the reason why\nIt's keeping me up at night (Hmm)\nI can smell you on the pillow where you used to lay\nAnd it's keeping me up at night\nAnd it's keeping me up\n[Chorus: Billy Raffoul]\nAnother night, another strangers door\nHoping when it opens I'll see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nYou (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\n[Verse 2: Billy Raffoul]\nYou're more than just a notch in my belt\nA story to tell\nThe only thing on my mind\nIt's obvious I'm not doing well\nDo you see these eyes, when have you known me to cry?\nI'm just sitting here remembering how your lips taste\nAnd it's keeping me up at night\nAnd it's keeping me up\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Billy Raffoul]\nAnother night, another strangers door\nHoping when it opens I'll see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nYou (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\n[Bridge: Billy Raffoul]\nWishing I could go back\nWishing I could go back\nWishing I could go back\nWishing I could go back\nTo that night\nTo that stranger's door\nKnowing when it opened I'd see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nYou (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nThat I'd see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\n[Outro: Billy Raffoul]\nHey, hey\nOh, oh\nSee you\nBaby\nBaby, (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nSee you\nI'd see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nI'd see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)",
